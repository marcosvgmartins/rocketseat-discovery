# RocketSeat Discovery

This repository contains the code developed during [RocketSeat's Discovery course](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/discover).

I am taking this course as part of my front-end learning path, something I've wanted to do for a long time, since I have mostly worked on the back-end of several systems.

## dev.finance$

This is the front-end of an app for controlling expenses.
